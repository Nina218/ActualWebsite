This is Eli! He's a little over a year old. We found him in our backyard so I have no clue what his birthday is, but we estimate it's somewhere around June. Thus, his honorary birthday is June 7th.

  When we first met him, my dad fed him pumpkin bread. It probably isn't very good for cats, but he ate it, and he stuck around.
  Truthfully, I have no idea how to tell a cat's gender, so I gave him a very gender-neutral name. People keep pronouncing it 'E-lie' instead of 'Ellie' but oh well.
  When I tried to meet him for the first time, he bit me. My dad was very worried about rabies, but it was fine!
  I ended up buying an actual bag of cat food becuaseI felt bad giving him our leftovers. I also sacrificed my stuffed animals, but he cuddled up to them and it was cute.
