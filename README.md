          <h2> Introduction </h2>
  <br>
This is Eli! He's a little over a year old. We found him in our backyard so I have no clue what his birthday is, but we estimate it's somewhere around June. Thus, his honorary birthday is June 7th.
  <br><br> 
  When we first met him, my dad fed him pumpkin bread. It probably isn't very good for cats, but he ate it, and he stuck around.
  Truthfully, I have no idea how to tell a cat's gender, so I gave him a very gender-neutral name. People keep pronouncing it 'E-lie' instead of 'Ellie' but oh well.
  When I tried to meet him for the first time, he bit me. My dad was very worried about rabies, but it was fine!
  I ended up buying an actual bag of cat food becuase I felt bad giving him our leftovers. I also sacrificed my stuffed animals, but he cuddled up to them instantly so it was worth it.

  You know something that's really hard to navigate but you don't realize it until you need it? Cat shelters. It's the worst. So many websites don't have "I've found a cat and I'd like to bring him in" option because they all think you want to find a cat when you're actually tying to find a home for him because your backyard really isn't the best place for one. There's information on not taking an adult cat to a shelter and leaving a kitten with their parents, but they don't tell you what an dult cv a kitten looks like and what to do about one that looks like a juvenile at best. I've emailed and called way too many shelters and organizations trying to find a place for a cat and a single one emailed me back. The shelters put me on hold for thirty minutes before I gave up. We drove to multiple shelters trying to find one that would take a kitten but the best thing they gave us was a voucher for neutering/spaying the cat of as of now unknown gender because they were all full. Eli was not happy about getting transported. People were rightfully concerned when we showed up with a very unhappy cat in a box because we had nowhere else to put him in.

  <p> Still, if you ever find yourself a stray, the following are several websites you can attempt to use.

  Eli hates baths. Since I suspected this, I used a dry wash shampoo instead because I was very sure he had fleas. I was right, but he hated the shampoo anyways. The first time I gave him a bath after my mom took him in, he screamed like we were murdering him. Eventually, he stopped, but I think it was because he realized he was a very small kittne and had no chance of escape. When I tried to bathe him this year, it did not go so well. Cats are very hard to hold on to when they don't want to be, and even though he rarely bites or claws hard enough to do actual damage, he was very mad at me for the rest of the day.
